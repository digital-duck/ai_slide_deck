**prompt**

```
I like to use prefect python dynamic workflow library, 
can you create a slide deck on its capability, quick setup, application, comparison with similar tools such as temporal, airflow

the first 10 slides should cover the basics, extra slides should go into "Appendix" section

Each slide should be an HTML page, save to file named as "<3-digits>-<slide-title>.html"

Please create a python script to create a navigational index HTML page,
where a sidebar on the left lists all the slide pages

the main page on the right will display each slide content

4 navigation buttons are listed are listed at the bottom, 
* "<<" - first slide
* "<" - previous slide
* ">" - next slide
* ">>" - last slide

```
